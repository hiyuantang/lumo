# Lumio OS

A locally rendered, macOS-inspired web desktop for administering a real
headless Ubuntu server.

Lumio OS runs in your browser but manages the actual machine: real files,
real systemd services, real journal logs, real users and permissions. It
feels like an operating system — a menu bar, a dock, movable windows, a
command center — but it never pretends the browser is running GNOME or
macOS, and it never hides the server behind a duplicate configuration
database.

The primary workflow is browsing VPS files, editing Markdown and text,
using a terminal and managing the system. The browser draws these tools
locally and exchanges file contents, terminal text and system data with
the server. Native graphical application and full-desktop streaming are
outside the product scope.

## What it is

- **A web desktop, not a dashboard.** After logging in you get a calm
  desktop with a menu bar, dock, windows, notifications and keyboard
  shortcuts. All shell interaction renders locally in the browser; moving
  a window or opening a menu never touches the network.
- **The live system is the source of truth.** Changes made over SSH or
  with other tools show up in the desktop immediately. There is no
  competing desired-state database.
- **Your normal Linux permissions.** You log in as a real Linux user and
  ordinary operations run as that user. Elevated actions go through a
  small, typed privileged broker (polkit + audit) — never a generic root
  shell.

### Core applications

| Application | What it controls |
|---|---|
| Home | Health, uptime, CPU, memory, storage, updates and alerts |
| Files | The real filesystem under your user's permissions |
| Markdown editor | Server Markdown/text files with local preview (planned; basic text editing exists in Files) |
| Terminal | A real PTY running as your Linux user |
| Services | systemd units, dependencies, start/stop/restart |
| Logs | journald with live filters and saved searches |
| Updates | Package refresh, upgrade plan, installation, reboot status |
| Storage | Disks, partitions, mounts, filesystems, SMART status |
| Network | Interfaces, addresses, DNS, routes, listeners, firewall |
| Containers | Docker/Podman containers, images, logs, Compose projects |
| Settings | Users, SSH keys, security, TLS, locale, time |

Command-line software is usable through Terminal. Applications that
already provide a web interface can be accessed separately. Lumio builds
focused interfaces for selected server capabilities; it does not recreate
every installed application. See [Product scope](docs/PRODUCT.md).

### Architecture at a glance

```text
Browser (React/TypeScript desktop, rendered locally)
        │  HTTPS — REST for requests, WebSocket for events
Web gateway (unprivileged)
        │  local Unix sockets
Per-user session agent (runs as your UID/GID)
        │  typed privileged requests
Privileged broker (root, tiny API surface, polkit + audit)
        │
systemd · journald · files · packages · network
```

The browser talks to an unprivileged gateway; a per-user agent performs
ordinary work as the authenticated user; a tiny root-owned broker handles
narrowly defined privileged actions (`services.restart`,
`packages.applyPlan`, …) with authorization, validation and audit. Risky
operations such as network or firewall changes are transactional with
automatic rollback.

### Supported systems

- **Primary:** Ubuntu 26.04 LTS (amd64 and arm64)
- **Compatibility:** Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- One server per browser session; no multi-host control plane.

## How to use it

> **Status: Phase 5 complete; Phases 6 and 7 in progress.** The desktop runs against mock data by default,
> or against a real Ubuntu host via the Lumio OS services: PAM login as
> a real Linux user, a per-user session agent (terminal and files run
> as that user), and a root privileged broker for typed service actions
> with polkit authorization and an audit trail. A source installer now
> provisions an account, a random port, HTTPS and startup services; its
> full systemd installation gate and public certificate issuance still
> need deployment verification. See [VPS installation](docs/INSTALL.md).
> Services includes dependencies, loaded unit files and related-log navigation;
> Logs includes boot/time filters, structured fields, saved searches, export
> and service navigation; Updates provides saved plans, security and size
> breakdowns, installation progress and reboot state; Files can validate and
> atomically update protected `/etc` files with rollback copies. Settings now
> schedules typed, reauthenticated reboot and shutdown actions through logind,
> while typed Netplan changes now use a broker-owned confirm-or-revert
> transaction. The gateway ships CSP, cross-origin opener/resource controls, permissions
> policy and no-store API responses. The Network app exposes live interfaces
> and the typed confirm-or-revert workflow. Firewall rollback and the
> remaining Phase 6/7 release work remain.
> Files already supports basic text editing; the Markdown workflow with
> local preview and unsaved-work protection is planned.
> The numbered flow below describes the intended experience once the
> first release ships.

Install this checkout on an Ubuntu VPS:

```sh
sudo bash scripts/install.sh
```

After verification succeeds, it prints the HTTPS address, generated
username and password. Upgrades preserve those details. The
[installation guide](docs/INSTALL.md) covers certificates, firewall ports,
existing accounts and password recovery.

Run the desktop with mock data:

```sh
npm install
npx playwright install chromium   # one-time, for tests
npm run dev                       # then open the printed localhost URL
```

Run it against a real Ubuntu host (or the Docker testbed):

```sh
scripts/build-with-web.sh         # builds lumiod with the UI embedded
# on the Ubuntu host, run the three services (see server/README.md):
#   lumiod broker & lumiod sessiond & lumiod gateway -web dist
ssh -L 8080:127.0.0.1:8080 user@host   # from your machine, then open http://localhost:8080
```

Log in with a real Linux account on the host. `scripts/integration-test.sh`
spins up a privileged systemd Ubuntu 24.04 container and runs the full
REST/WebSocket assertion suite — login, per-user terminal, service
restart via the broker, package-plan progress, protected file rollback,
audit rows, and the failed-web-service repair exit gate.

Useful shortcuts: `⌘/Ctrl+K` command center, `Alt+W` close window,
`Ctrl+Alt+←/→` cycle windows. `npm test` runs the Playwright tests;
`npm run build` typechecks and builds.

The target experience for the first release:

1. **Install** one Ubuntu package on your server.
2. **Connect** to `https://VPS-IP:port` or a configured hostname over HTTPS
   and log in as a real Linux user.
3. **Land on the desktop** — check host health on Home, browse files,
   edit and preview Markdown, open a terminal, inspect and control services,
   stream logs.
4. **Elevate only when needed** — privileged actions ask for
   authorization and are recorded in an audit trail.
5. **Uninstall cleanly** at any time without damaging the server.

### Contributing / development

Development is specification-driven; the product, design and security
specifications are maintained alongside the code. See
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the project mission and working rules.

This is an independent, clean-room implementation. Do not clone or
inspect third-party server-management projects for implementation
reference; build from the project's specifications and official Ubuntu,
systemd, D-Bus, polkit and web-standards documentation.
